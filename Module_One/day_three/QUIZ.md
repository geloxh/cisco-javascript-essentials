### Section Quiz

1. Use console.log to output your full name to the console.
 ```javascript
    console.log("Minato Namikaze");
```
2. Output your year of birth.
```javascript
    console.log("1998");
```
3. Try again to output your year of birth, this time passing the date without the quotes.
```javascript
    console.log(1998);
```
4. We can pass several arguments to console.log separated by commas, e.g.:
```javascript
    console.log("My name is", "Minato Namikaze", "and I was born in", 1998);
```
5. Output the same information (name, surname, year) to the console, not side by side, but on consecutive lines.
```javascript
    console.log("Minato");
    console.log("Namikaze");
    console.log("1998");
```
6. A string can be concatenated using the + sign, for example "abc" + "def" will be treated as "abcdef". Try writing your name, surname, and year of birth on one line again, this time not separated by commas, but by + signs.
```javascript
    console.log("Minato" + "Namikaze" + "1998");
```
7. Put spaces in the appropriate places, so that when displayed, you get the same effect as in Question 4.
```javascript
    console.log("Minato " + "Namikaze " + "(1998)");
```
