### Day 2.1 - About JavaScript
Day 2 of Learning, and it covers the following topics:
## Communicating with the computer
in order to help in communication with the computer, programming languages were invented that are somewhat similar to natural languages (that is, those used for communication between people). There are thousands of programming languages, and they differ in purpose (aside from general-purpose languages, there are many specialized ones, for example, languages designed only for statistical calculations), level of abstraction (in simple terms: the higher the language level, the less we need to know about the hardware on which the program is executed), ease of use, effectiveness of the programs written in them, etc.
## JavaScript as an interpreted language
JavaScript is a typical interpreted language. If we run a code written in JavaScript in a web browser, as it is happening, such as after loading the page we are currently reading (yes, yes, there are elements written in JavaScript on this page too), the interpreter will be the JavaScript engine built into the browser. This is not the only way to execute JavaScript code.

Perhaps you have heard of node.js. It is also an interpreter, but installed independently of browsers as an environment in the computer's operating system (it can be macOS, Windows, or Linux). Using node.js allows you to write programs in JavaScript that will, for example, turn your computer into a server.

Most modern JavaScript engines use the Just In Time Compilation technique (JIT Compilation). This technique consists of compiling code fragments during the execution of the program (more than a single instruction) and allows you to increase its performance. However, from the user's point of view, such a change is virtually unnoticeable – it still looks as if only the interpreter is executing the source code, instruction by instruction.

Regardless of the language you choose, a few things remain the same while writing the program. First of all, an important, and probably the most difficult, stage of this process is to correctly define the problem we want to solve. Only then do we try to find the optimal solution, which we will finally present in the form of a program written in the chosen language.

So before you start explaining something to the computer, in other words, writing a program, you need to understand exactly what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it. Secondly, the solution we propose and write in the form of a program must be 100% unambiguous – the computer cannot guess anything.

A simple example from a slightly different field: at some point in your life, you probably happened to buy a piece of furniture that required assembly. Assembling it is a problem that you, the buyer, have been burdened with. In order for you to cope with this task, you get a set of instructions to guide you through the whole process. You’re acting as an interpreter at this point, using a program that will allow you to complete the task. The success of your mission depends on the quality of these instructions, whether they are precise and unambiguous, and do not come from another piece of furniture. In the end, it may turn out that you have constructed not the furniture of your dreams, but a surrealistic construction from another dimension.

For the instructions to be good, someone who develops them must know exactly what they should illustrate, in what order certain actions should be carried out, at which stages something is easiest to confuse, and so on. And of course, they must know what effect is to be achieved at the end.

## Client-side vs server-side programming
The use of JavaScript on websites, which over time has become more and more complex and often contain very sophisticated logic, is called client-side programming. The code to be executed is loaded together with the page in the browser, on the user's side, and the interpreter which is a part of the web browser allows for its execution.

Today, JavaScript is the sole language supported by all major web browsers, and about 95% of web pages worldwide embed JavaScript code within them. From the beginning, web pages used JavaScript on the client-side to add interactivity and dynamically change the content.

Now it’s much more than that, as JavaScript offers many great frameworks on which to build huge, complex web applications and social networks (you've probably heard the names of frameworks like React or Angular).

All this can work on a variety of equipment, from high-performance workstations to simple smartphones. Thanks to the power of JavaScript, we can order food, play browser-based games, watch movies on streaming platforms, and be in constant contact with the people important to us. JavaScript is so popular that continually more and more effort goes into using it, not only as a client-side solution.

Over time, JavaScript began to appear in other areas, such as programming the server-side parts of complex web applications, also called back-end. These programs are executed on servers, processing data (e.g. from databases), which after processing will be available on the client side. The flexibility of this language and its relative simplicity have made it much more applicable, for example, in mobile apps, or even in programming UAVs (some drones run programs written in this language).
