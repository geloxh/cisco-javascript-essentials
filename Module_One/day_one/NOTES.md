### Day 1 - Welcome To JavaScript Essentials

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the JavaScript language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.

The course focuses on the JavaScript language core concepts, including the essentials of the JavaScript syntax and semantics, best programming practices, JS tools and resources, and coding concepts such as variables, data types, type casting, operators, user interaction, control flow, functions, errors, exceptions, debugging, and troubleshooting. 

## Course Structure
```
The course is divided into six modules:

    Module 1
    Introduction to JavaScript and Computer Programming;

    Module 2
    Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Comments;

    Module 3
    Operators and User Interaction;

    Module 4
    Control Flow – Conditional Execution and Loops;

    Module 5
    Functions;

    Module 6
    Errors, exceptions, debugging, and troubleshooting.
```

### Syllabus

## Module 1 - Introduction to JavaScript and Computer Programming
    - About JavaScript (how to communicate with the computer, what is JS, advantages and limitations of JS, where is JS used today)

    - Setting up the programming environment (development tools, online development environment, local development environment)

    - First JS program – Hello, World! (a few words about HTML, how to run your JavaScript code, executing the code directly in the console)

## Module 2 - Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Comments
    - Variables (naming, declaring and initializing variables, declarations and strict mode, changing variable values, constants, scope)

    - Primitive data types (Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, undefined, null, type casting – primitive construction functions and primitive conversions, implicit conversions)

    - Complex data types (Object, Array, basic Array properties and methods)

    - Comments (single-line comments, multi-line comments, documentation)

## Module 3 - OPerations and User Interaction
    - Assignment, arithmetic, and logical operators (what are operators, assignment operators, arithmetic operators, logical operators, compound assignment operators)

    - Strings, comparison, and other JS operators (string concatenation and compound assignments, comparison operators, conditional operators, typeof, instanceof and delete operators, operator precedence)

    - Interacting with the user (dialog boxes – alert, confirm, prompt)

## Module 4 - Control Flow – Conditional Execution and Loops
    - Conditional execution (what is conditional execution, the if–else statement, the conditional operator, the switch–case statement)

    - Loops (what are loops, the while loop, the do–while loop, the for loop, the for–of loop, the for–in loop, the break and continue statements)

## Module 5 - Functions
    - Function basics (what are functions, declaring functions, calling functions, local variables, the return statement, function parameters, shadowing)

    - Functions as first-class members (function expressions, passing a function as a parameter, callbacks)

    - Arrow functions (declaring and calling)

    - Recursion (basic idea)

## Module 6 - Errors, exceptions, debugging, and troubleshooting
    - Errors and exceptions – introduction (natural languages and communication errors, errors vs. exceptions, errors without exceptions, limited confidence)

    - Basic types of errors in JS (SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, RangeError)

    - Exception handling (the try–catch statement, the finally statement, the throw statement, and custom errors)

    - Code debugging and troubleshooting (what is debugging, step-by-step execution, viewing and modifying variables, the step out option, measuring code execution time)

## Advance Takeaways Upon Completing
    - know the syntax of the core JavaScript language to a degree that will allow for working with variables, operators, flow control, and functions;

    - know the basics of the JavaScript data types system, distinguishing between primitive and complex types, and is able to choose a type adequate to their needs;

    - think algorithmically and be able to analyze a problem using a programmatic conceptual apparatus;

    - be able to choose a data type adequate to the problem being solved and use suitable flow control means;

    - be able to design, develop, and improve very simple JavaScript programs;

    - be able to interpret and handle basic exceptions related to errors in program execution;

    - understand a programmer's work in the software development process and the role of fundamental development tools;

    - know how a program is interpreted and executed in an actual computer environment, local or remote;
    
    - have the necessary skills and knowledge to start creating and developing your own programming portfolio.
