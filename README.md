### Cisco Training - JavaScript Essentials
My repository for the Cisco JavaScript Essentials course progress from beginning to finish the course.
## About the Training
The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the JavaScript language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.

The course focuses on the JavaScript language core concepts, including the essentials of the JavaScript syntax and semantics, best programming practices, JS tools and resources, and coding concepts such as variables, data types, type casting, operators, user interaction, control flow, functions, errors, exceptions, debugging, and troubleshooting.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood software and web development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also web design, front-end development, and application testing.
